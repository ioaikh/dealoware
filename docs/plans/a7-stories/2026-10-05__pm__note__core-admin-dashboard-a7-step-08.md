# A7 Step 8 — Audit log for auth and edit/delete, keyed HMAC IP, same-transaction pairing (core admin dashboard)

**Track:** A7 Core admin dashboard build, Core admin at `admin.core.dealoware.com`. Dev Plan Step 8.
**Tracker:** this file is the A7 Story of record until GitHub Issues are re-enabled on the repo.
**Type:** UI. Audit writer and keyed HMAC IP on the backend, plus the UI case TD-ADM-101 step 2 that needs the audit viewer. The viewer screen itself is owned by Step 15. This Story carries the UI/UX gate (UX1-X09, UXR-D16).

## Owner
- **Chief Developer**
- Source: PM admin dashboard checklist A7 lanes (backend and auth Steps 1–6 and 8 with the Chief Developer).

## Acceptance criteria (traced from Spec v2.2 through Dev Plan §4 Step 8 and §5)
- AC7 / Spec §8.8, §10 — append-only audit table in Core Postgres; no update or delete from the admin UI or API.
- Auth events: login_success, login_failure (reason class), reset_request, reset_complete, totp_enroll, totp_change, recovery_code_use.
- Every successful admin edit/delete is audited, plus cascade rows with a correlation id; the soft-deleted toggle is not audited.
- Auth audit IP is a keyed HMAC-SHA256 of the client IP (server-side rotatable secret), never raw or unkeyed.
- Audit insert runs in the same DB transaction as the mutation; if it fails, the mutation rolls back.
- Snapshots hold FieldPolicy-allowed fields only, no secrets; bodies over 4 KiB truncated with length and hash. Retain indefinitely this slice.

## Test-design cases this Story must satisfy (test design §3.5, Step 8)
- `TD-ADM-053`, `TD-ADM-064`, `TD-ADM-080`, `TD-ADM-100`, `TD-ADM-101`, `TD-ADM-102`

## Gates (in order)
**Before code starts (UI/UX first launch rule):** UX1 approval of this Story's part: Chief UI/UX approval plus a UI/UX QA PASS file under `docs/verification/` (Chief UI/UX names it).

**At PR review:**
1. **Dev Code QA PASS file** under `docs/verification/` (Code QA names it; prior Story pattern `YYYY-MM-DD__sd__verification__<story>.md`). Test design §5: P0 API/integration cases for the mapped TD-ADM IDs are green.
2. **Security PASS file** under `docs/verification/` (prior SD-step pattern `YYYY-MM-DD__security__verification__<story>-sd-qa-confirm.md`).
3. **Chief UI/UX approval plus a UI/UX QA PASS file** on the built UI, under `docs/verification/`.
4. **Bot Manager merges.**

Deploy waits for Ivan's OK via Bot Manager.

## Active holds
- Merge waits for the Dev Code QA PASS file.
- Merge waits for the Security PASS file.
- Bot Manager does the merge, and only after the PASS files above exist.
- Deploy waits for Ivan's OK via Bot Manager.
- UI build waits for UX1 approval of these screens.
- Whether UI test cases run headless in CI on every PR that touches admin UI files (UX1-X08, UXR-D15) is a decision for Chief QA and Chief DevOps. Addendum D.7 proposes that until then UI cases run locally and block merge by review.

## Out of scope (Dev Plan Step 12 and §7)
- Audit purge (later slice).

## Rules
- Core admin host only: `admin.core.dealoware.com`. Platform hosts are not Core.
- No password values anywhere: code, fixtures, README, chat, or commit history. Use env placeholders only.
- No AWS account details, account IDs, ARNs, region, SES identity, Turnstile keys, or HMAC key values in code, docs, or PRs.
