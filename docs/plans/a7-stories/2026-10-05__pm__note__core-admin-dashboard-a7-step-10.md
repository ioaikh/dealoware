# A7 Step 10 — Confirm-before-delete and soft-delete cascades (core admin dashboard)

**Track:** A7 Core admin dashboard build, Core admin at `admin.core.dealoware.com`. Dev Plan Step 10.
**Tracker:** this file is the A7 Story of record until GitHub Issues are re-enabled on the repo.
**Type:** UI. Confirm-before-delete modal on the entity screens.

## Owner
- **Senior Developer**
- Source: PM admin dashboard checklist A7 lanes (entity API and UI Steps 7, 9, 10 with the Senior Developer).

## Acceptance criteria (traced from Spec v2.2 through Dev Plan §4 Step 10 and §5)
- AC7 / Spec §9 — UI modal shows entity type, identity, and cascade summary; cancel leaves data unchanged and writes no delete audit.
- AC7 / Spec §9 — API `POST …/delete-intent` returns a `confirmToken`; delete must present it; blind DELETE is rejected; token single-use, 5 min, bound to actor, entity, and cascade set.
- AC7 / Spec §11.1 — soft-delete via `DeletedAt`; hard delete deferred entirely.
- AC7 / Spec §11.2–§11.3 — cascades: offer deletes that offer; negotiation deletes itself plus child offers (warn if open); Artifact delete blocked while a non-deleted negotiation references it; Participant deletes itself plus its negotiations and their offers, never auto-deleting Artifacts.
- Cascade soft-deletes are audited with a correlation id.

## Test-design cases this Story must satisfy (test design §3.5, Step 10)
- `TD-ADM-060`, `TD-ADM-061`, `TD-ADM-090`, `TD-ADM-091`, `TD-ADM-092`, `TD-ADM-093`, `TD-ADM-094`, `TD-ADM-095`, `TD-ADM-130`

## Gates (in order)
**Before code starts (UI/UX first launch rule):** UX1 approval of this Story's part: Chief UI/UX approval plus a UI/UX QA PASS file under `docs/verification/` (Chief UI/UX names it).

**At PR review:**
1. **Dev Code QA PASS file** under `docs/verification/` (Code QA names it; prior Story pattern `YYYY-MM-DD__sd__verification__<story>.md`). Test design §5: P0 API/integration cases for the mapped TD-ADM IDs are green.
2. **Security PASS file** under `docs/verification/` (prior SD-step pattern `YYYY-MM-DD__security__verification__<story>-sd-qa-confirm.md`).
3. **Chief UI/UX approval plus a UI/UX QA PASS file** on the built UI, under `docs/verification/`.
4. **Bot Manager merges.**

Deploy waits for Ivan's OK via Bot Manager.

## Active holds
- Merge waits for the Dev Code QA PASS file.
- Merge waits for the Security PASS file.
- Bot Manager does the merge, and only after the PASS files above exist.
- Deploy waits for Ivan's OK via Bot Manager.
- UI build waits for UX1 approval of these screens.
- Whether UI test cases run headless in CI on every PR that touches admin UI files (UX1-X08, UXR-D15) is a decision for Chief QA and Chief DevOps. Addendum D.7 proposes that until then UI cases run locally and block merge by review.

## Out of scope (Dev Plan Step 12 and §7)
- Hard delete in this slice.
- Settlement, escrow, and checkout cascades.

## Rules
- Core admin host only: `admin.core.dealoware.com`. Platform hosts are not Core.
- No password values anywhere: code, fixtures, README, chat, or commit history. Use env placeholders only.
- No AWS account details, account IDs, ARNs, region, SES identity, Turnstile keys, or HMAC key values in code, docs, or PRs.
